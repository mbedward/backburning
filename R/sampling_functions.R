#' Generate lines of sample points across back-burning line features
#'
#' Given a set of input line features representing back-burning lines, this
#' function places sample lines at regular intervals along each input feature,
#' perpendicular to the local feature angle, and then generates uniformly spaced
#' points along each sample line. Local angles are determined from a smoothed
#' version of the back-burning line to minimize the influence of any local kinks
#' and turns. Sample lines are located at, and either side of, the mid-point of
#' each input feature. At each sampling line, a sample point is located where
#' the line intersects the back-burning line, then further points are placed
#' along the line at uniform spacing. In cases where a back-burning line is
#' curved or convoluted it is possible for sampling lines from one section to
#' approach or cross other sections. Setting the argument
#' \code{increasing_distance} to \code{TRUE} (the default) will test for such
#' cases and prune sampling lines as required. This can result in different
#' numbers of sample points per line being returned.
#'
#' This function calls the non-exported helper function
#' \code{make_sample_lines()} to generate the sample lines along which the
#' sample points are placed.
#'
#' @param bb_lines An \code{sf} spatial data frame containing one or more line
#'   features representing back-burning lines. The data must have a coordinate
#'   reference system defined with metres as map units (e.g. NSW Lambert/GDA94
#'   EPSG:3308).
#'
#' @param bb_id (character; default "OID") The name of a column in the
#'   \code{bb_lines} data frame that uniquely identifies back-burning line
#'   features.
#'
#' @param line_spacing A single numeric value for the distance in metres
#'   between sampling lines along each back-burning line feature.
#'
#' @param line_half_length A single numeric value specifying the maximum
#'   distance in metres that a sampling line will extend on either side of the
#'   back-burning line.
#'
#' @param point_spacing A single numeric value specifying the uniform distance
#'   between sample points along each sampling line. The first point is always
#'   positioned at the intersection of the sampling line and the reference
#'   back-burning line.
#'
#' @param increasing_distance (character) One of \code{('all', 'parent',
#'   'none')}. May be abbreviated. If \code{'all'} (default), each sample point
#'   must lie at a greater distance to all back-burning lines than the preceding
#'   point; if \code{'parent'}, a similar increasing distance rule is applied
#'   but only in relation to the parent back-burning line that the sample points
#'   are associated with; if \code{'none'}, no distance rule applies.
#'
#' @param smoothing_bw A single numeric value for the bandwidth (metres) of the
#'   Gaussian kernel filter used to smooth each back-burning feature. The
#'   default value of 1000m seems to give good results.
#'
#' @return An \code{sf} spatial data frame of sample point features with the
#'   following columns:
#'
#'   \code{refid} Identifier of the input back-burning line feature that a point
#'   is sampling, with values taken from the input data column specified by the
#'   \code{bb_id} argument.
#'
#'   \code{index} Integer index (from 1) of the perpendicular sample line on
#'   which the point was positioned.
#'
#'   \code{segment} One of \code{'X'} (point at intersection with back-burning
#'   line); \code{'L'} (point on left of line); \code{'R'} (point on right of
#'   line). Note that left and right are relative to the digitizing direction
#'   (i.e. order of vertices) of the back-burning line.
#'
#'   \code{dist_line} Distance of the point along the sample line segment on
#'   which it was positioned, relative to the parent back-burning line.
#'
#'   \code{dist_parent} Shortest distance from the point to the parent
#'   back-burning line. This can be less than \code{dist_line} if the parent
#'   line is wiggly.
#'
#'   \code{dist_all} Shortest distance from the point to \strong{any}
#'   back-burning line. This column will only be present if the argument
#'   \code{increasing_distance == 'all'}.
#'
#'   \code{geom} Point geometry, projected in the same coordinate reference
#'   system as the input line features.
